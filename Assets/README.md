## Description 

This is my first attempt at coding a portfolio using HTML and CSS. I wanted to have some fun and give the landing page some personality by adding animations. My other pages used only bootstrap. Hopefully this will serve as a jumping off point for creating a better portfolio with javascript. My main goal was to experiment and create a visually appealing website, and in that regard I believe I was successful. I definitely learned a lot messing around and seeing what was possible.

## Credits

I used some code to make an animation from here: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/
